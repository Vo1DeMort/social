Web apps can be classified into various types based on their functionality, purpose, and how they interact with users.
Here are some common types of web apps:

    Static Web Apps: Static web apps consist of fixed content and do not change based on user interactions.
    They are created using HTML, CSS, and possibly some JavaScript for basic animations or effects. These apps
    are suitable for displaying information that doesn't require frequent updates.


    Dynamic Web Apps: Dynamic web apps use server-side technologies (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, Node.js) to
    generate content dynamically based on user requests and interactions. They fetch data from databases or APIs and render it to users. Social media platforms and e-commerce sites are examples of dynamic web apps.


    E-commerce Web Apps: E-commerce apps are online platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of products
    or services. They typically include features like product catalogs, shopping carts, user accounts, payment gateways,
    and order processing.


    Social Media Web Apps: Social media apps enable users to create profiles, share content (text, images, videos),
    connect with friends, follow others, and engage in discussions or interactions within the platform.


    Content Management Systems (CMS): CMS web apps allow users to create, manage, and publish digital content on the web.
    They are widely used for blogs, news websites, and other content-heavy platforms.


    Collaboration Tools: These apps are designed to facilitate collaboration among users or teams. Examples include project
    management tools, online document editors, and real-time messaging platforms.


    Real-Time Web Apps: Real-time web apps provide instantaneous updates to users without the need for page refresh.
    They use technologies like WebSockets or long polling to enable real-time communication between the server and the client.


    Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): PWAs are web apps that leverage modern web technologies to offer an app-like experience 
    to users. They work offline, provide push notifications, and can be installed on the user's device.


    Single Page Applications (SPAs): SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content as users interact
    with the app. They offer a seamless user experience and are often built using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.


    Mobile Web Apps: Mobile web apps are optimized for mobile devices and can be accessed through web browsers on smartphones
    and tablets. They provide a mobile-friendly interface without requiring users to download or install anything.


    Web-Based Games: Web-based games are interactive applications that run within web browsers. They can range from simple
    puzzle games to more complex multiplayer experiences.


    Web APIs: While not traditional web apps, web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different applications to 
    communicate and share data over the internet. They are the foundation for building web services and integrating various systems.


These are just a few examples of the diverse range of web apps available today. The type of web app you choose to develop
depends on the specific requirements and goals of your project.
